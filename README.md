# TD7-Cloud-Eya

First I opened git bash and I put the path of my actual folder containing all my files : cd /my-folder-path/

Next I started by runing git init command to initialize a new git repository 

Then git add to add my current files or any new or modified files to the index

Next I run git commit with the option -m to add a message of commit. It's useful when a team is working on the same project

After that, I git pull origin main to run fetches commits from the master branch of the origin remote (into the local origin/master branch), and then it merges origin/master into the branch you currently have checked out.

And finally I run git push -u origin main  to push my work in the selected branch
